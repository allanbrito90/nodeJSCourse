/*
I just use this project to test if my Node Js installation was succedded.

So, if you want to install, you must access this website

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

And download the lastest version (LTS is better if you are a beginner)
After install, access this folder by command prompt and run by typing

node test.js

If the prompt answer "Hello World", you're done.

console.log("Hello World");
